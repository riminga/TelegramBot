The program in Java that compares any 2 images and shows the differences visually by drawing rectangles.*

Implementation is using only standard core language and platform features, no 3rd party libraries and plagiarized code is permitted.

Pixels (with the same coordinates in two images) can be visually similar, but have different values of RGB. We are only consider 2 pixels to be "different" if the difference between them is more than 10%.

The output of the comparison is a copy of one of the images image with differences outlined with red rectangles as shown below.

No third party libraries and borrowed code are not using.
